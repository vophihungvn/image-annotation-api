## Production Deployment

Suppose that this application will be deploy AWS
Database will be hosted by RDS.

#### Diagram

#### Deployment steps

- (1) Prepare infrastructure, create EC2 instance, RDS
- (2) Build docker image, push to ECR
- (3) SSH to EC2 instance, install docker
- (4) Pull latest image, map domain and internal p·ªèt

Note:

- Step (1) only do once
- When new release is made, step (2) and (4) will be done
- For zero downtime during deployment, we can start 2 backend server and create a load balancer to share request between them. When deploy, we deploy one by one so every request will have a handler

- For further scale and automate the deployment, we can setup with following infra
